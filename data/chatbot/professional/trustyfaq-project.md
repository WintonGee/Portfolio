# TrustyFAQ Project

## Project Overview

**Name**: TrustyFAQ  
**Status**: In Progress (2024-2025)  
**Live URL**: https://trustyfaq.vercel.app/

## Problem I Solved

### Challenge

Team leads at Mercor were constantly bombarded with repetitive FAQ-type questions, even when comprehensive FAQs already existed. This created burnout and productivity loss.

### Root Cause Analysis

- **Scrolling Fatigue**: People don't want to scroll through long FAQ lists
- **Immediate Gratification**: Team members want instant answers, not search sessions
- **Context Switching**: Traditional FAQs require users to leave their workflow
- **Poor Search UX**: Keyword-based search often returns irrelevant results
- **Information Overload**: Long FAQ documents are overwhelming and hard to navigate

### The Real Impact

- **Team Lead Burnout**: Constant interruptions with repetitive questions
- **Productivity Loss**: Time spent answering questions that could be self-served
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Important information exists but isn't easily discoverable
- **Frustration**: Both question-askers and answer-providers experience friction

## My Solution Approach

### Strategy

Build a semantic search system that provides instant, relevant answers without scrolling through traditional FAQ lists.

### Key Problem-Solving Steps

1. **Semantic Search Implementation**: Used pgvector for vector-based similarity search
2. **AI-Powered Responses**: Integrated Google Gemini for intelligent content generation
3. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Built secure, scalable platform with proper data isolation
4. **Real-Time Search**: Implemented debounced search with instant results

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Vector Search Performance

**Problem**: Large-scale semantic search with thousands of FAQ entries  
**Solution**: Implemented efficient pgvector indexing and query optimization

### Challenge 2: Multi-Tenant Security

**Problem**: Ensuring data isolation between different organizations  
**Solution**: Used Supabase Row Level Security with workspace-based policies

### Challenge 3: AI Integration Complexity

**Problem**: Integrating Google Gemini API with proper error handling  
**Solution**: Built robust API wrapper with fallback responses and rate limiting

### Challenge 4: Real-Time Search Experience

**Problem**: Providing instant search results as users type  
**Solution**: Implemented debounced search with React Query caching

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core Tables
users - Extended user profiles with plan information
profiles - FAQ workspaces/spaces
faqs - Individual FAQ entries with vector embeddings

-- Vector Search
faqs.embedding - Vector representation of FAQ content
-- Search using pgvector similarity functions
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/faqs/search` - Semantic search with vector similarity
- `POST /api/faqs` - Create new FAQ entries
- `PUT /api/faqs/:id` - Update existing FAQ content
- `GET /api/faqs/public/:workspace` - Public FAQ access
- `POST /api/ai/generate` - AI-powered content generation

### Vector Search Implementation

```python
# Semantic search using pgvector
async def search_faqs(query: str, workspace_id: str):
    # Generate embedding for search query
    query_embedding = await generate_embedding(query)

    # Search using vector similarity
    results = await db.execute(
        """
        SELECT *, embedding <=> %s as distance
        FROM faqs
        WHERE workspace_id = %s
        ORDER BY distance
        LIMIT 10
        """,
        [query_embedding, workspace_id]
    )
    return results
```
