# Portfolio Website Project

## Project Overview

**Name**: AI-Powered Portfolio Website  
**Status**: Completed (2024)  
**Live URL**: https://wintongee.com  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/WintonGee/Portfolio

## Problem I Solved

### Challenge

Traditional portfolio websites are static and don't effectively showcase AI/ML engineering skills. They lack interactivity and don't demonstrate technical capabilities in real-time.

### Root Issues

- Static portfolios don't show AI/ML expertise in action
- No way for visitors to interact with AI capabilities
- Limited demonstration of technical problem-solving skills
- Poor user engagement with traditional portfolio layouts

## My Solution Approach

### Strategy

Build an interactive, AI-powered portfolio that demonstrates technical skills through real-time interactions and intelligent features.

### Key Problem-Solving Steps

1. **Interactive Skill Demonstration**: Created hover cards that show exactly where each technology was used in real projects
2. **AI Integration**: Built a chatbot powered by Google Gemini that can answer questions about my work and experience
3. **Technical Showcase**: Used advanced animations and modern web technologies to demonstrate full-stack capabilities
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented Next.js SSR and image optimization to showcase technical expertise

## Tools & Technologies Used

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js 14**: App Router, SSR, and performance optimization
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **React.js**: Component-based architecture with hooks
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animations and transitions

### AI Integration

- **Google Gemini AI**: Real-time AI responses and content generation
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic search for relevant information
- **API Routes**: Secure AI communication with proper error handling

### Development Tools

- **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Hover Card Z-Index Issues

**Problem**: Hover cards were appearing behind other elements due to stacking context  
**Solution**: Implemented React portals to render cards directly to document.body, bypassing z-index conflicts

### Challenge 2: AI Integration Complexity

**Problem**: Integrating Google Gemini AI with proper error handling and streaming  
**Solution**: Built robust API routes with fallback responses and proper error boundaries

### Challenge 3: Performance with Animations

**Problem**: Complex animations impacting page performance  
**Solution**: Used Framer Motion's optimization features and reduced motion preferences

### Challenge 4: Responsive Design Complexity

**Problem**: Ensuring consistent experience across all devices  
**Solution**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind's responsive utilities and custom breakpoints
