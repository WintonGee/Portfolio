## Project Overview

Developed a high-performance sentiment analysis API that processes social media posts in real-time. The system uses state-of-the-art transformer models to provide accurate sentiment analysis with sub-second response times.

## Technical Architecture

### API Design

- **Framework**: FastAPI with async/await support
- **Authentication**: JWT-based API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based rate limiting
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs

### Model Implementation

- **Base Model**: RoBERTa-large for sentiment analysis
- **Optimization**: Model quantization and ONNX conversion
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently analyzed text

### Infrastructure

- **Cloud Provider**: AWS with auto-scaling
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer

## Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: 10,000+ requests per minute
- **Latency**: Average 150ms response time
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Cost**: $0.001 per 1000 requests

## API Features

- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple texts in single request
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection and routing
- **Confidence Scores**: Sentiment confidence levels
- **Custom Models**: Support for domain-specific models

## Deployment and Scaling

The API is deployed on AWS with:

- Auto-scaling groups based on CPU and memory usage
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
