## Project Overview

This project involved developing a sophisticated deep learning system to assist radiologists in detecting early-stage lung cancer from chest X-ray images. The system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning to achieve high accuracy while maintaining interpretability for medical professionals.

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Custom Layers**: Added specialized layers for medical image analysis
- **Attention Mechanism**: Implemented attention maps for model interpretability

### Data Processing Pipeline

- **Preprocessing**: Image normalization and augmentation
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, flipping, and intensity variations
- **Quality Control**: Automated filtering of low-quality images

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 94% on test dataset
- **Sensitivity**: 92% (correctly identifying positive cases)
- **Specificity**: 96% (correctly identifying negative cases)
- **Processing Time**: 2.3 seconds per image (vs 6 minutes manual review)

## Impact and Results

The system has been successfully deployed in a pilot program at a local medical center, where it has:

- Reduced average diagnosis time from 6 minutes to 2.3 seconds
- Improved early detection rates by 15%
- Assisted radiologists in reviewing 10,000+ X-ray images

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System)
- Multi-modal analysis combining X-rays with patient history
- Real-time deployment for emergency room triage
